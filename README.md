\# 🎭 Multimodal Deepfake Detection System



\## 📌 Overview

This project presents a \*\*Multimodal Deepfake Detection System\*\* that identifies fake or manipulated media by analyzing both \*\*video\*\* and \*\*audio\*\* content.  

The system uses \*\*CNN-based models\*\* to detect visual deepfake artifacts from facial regions and synthetic voice patterns from audio signals.



The multimodal approach improves robustness, as deepfake content may bypass single-modality detection.

\## 🔍 Methodology



\### 🔹 Video Pipeline

\- Frame extraction using OpenCV

\- Face detection and cropping using MTCNN (Haar Cascade as fallback)

\- CNN-based classification to detect visual manipulation artifacts



\### 🔹 Audio Pipeline

\- Audio extraction using FFmpeg

\- Optional noise reduction

\- Feature extraction using:

&nbsp; - Mel Spectrogram

&nbsp; - MFCC

\- CNN-based classification for synthetic voice detection



---



\## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using:

\- Accuracy

\- Precision

\- Recall

\- F1-score

\- Confusion Matrix



These metrics ensure balanced evaluation, especially important for deepfake detection where false positives and false negatives must be minimized.

\## 📊 Model Comparison

\- \*\*Video CNN\*\*: Detects facial texture and manipulation artifacts

\- \*\*Audio CNN\*\*: Detects spectral inconsistencies in synthetic speech

\- \*\*Mel Spectrogram vs MFCC\*\*:  

&nbsp; Mel spectrograms perform better for CNN-based classification due to richer time–frequency representation

\- \*\*Multimodal Approach\*\*: Improves robustness by combining both modalities



---



\## 🔮 Future Scope

\- Social media fake account detection

\- Real-time deepfake detection

\- Behavioral and metadata analysis

\- Temporal models (LSTM / Transformers)

\- Web and mobile deployment
